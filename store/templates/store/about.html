      <h3>From empty rooms to composed spaces</h3>
      <p class="product__desc">
        Opera Home started with bare apartments that felt flat and unfinished.
        The question was simple:
        <em>what if a few well-chosen pieces could change the mood of an entire room?</em>
        Each collection we design is an answer to that question.
      </p>
      <p class="product__desc">
        Our team sketches, prototypes and tests in real homes. Anything that feels
        unnecessary is removed. What remains are confident, easy-to-combine pieces
        that stay relevant as your life and space change.

      <h3>How we build a collection</h3>
      <ul class="product__desc about-list">
        <li>Start with a mood: evening light, a colour story, a type of gathering at home.</li>
        <li>Define a small family of core pieces: seating, tables, lighting and key decor.</li>
        <li>Design supporting objects that layer in without visual noise.</li>
        <li>Style everything together so you can recreate the look with just a few items.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="product__desc">
        The result: rooms that feel curated, warm and lived-in, never like a crowded showroom.

    <h3>Made for the way you really live</h3>
    <p class="product__desc">
      Whether you are furnishing your first apartment or refreshing a long-loved home,
      Opera Home is designed to give you fewer, better choices. Mix a single statement
      piece into what you already own or build an entire room from our signature palette—
      either way, your space should feel intentional, calm and unmistakably yours.
