    <h3>Our Studio Story</h3>
    <p class="product__desc">
      Opera Home began with a simple question:
      <em>what if everyday objects felt like they belonged in a boutique hotel,
      without the boutique price?</em>
      Our designers and engineers work together to remove visual noise, refine
      proportions, and obsess over the touches you feel every single day.
    </p>
    <p class="product__desc">
      We prototype in small batches, test in real homes, and only release what
      meets our standards for comfort, durability, and timeless appeal.
